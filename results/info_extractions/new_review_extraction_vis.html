Se7en 
-Movie Review- 
5/5 
David Fincher’s “Se7en” is <span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">one of the most sinisterly dismal and 
disturbing films of all time</span>, but simultaneously, it has <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">an 
eminently memorable and powerful message</span>. Standing out from 
other crime movies, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">its ingenious concept</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">keeps us on the edge 
of our seat throughout the whole film</span>, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">has us stunned after 
what may just be one of the most sensational endings in the 
history of cinema</span>.  
Se7en follows two detectives, Somerset(Morgan Freeman) and 
Mills(Brad Pitt) on their hunt for a deranged serial killer. The 
reoccurring murders follow a pattern and an idea - they are 
committed according to the 7 deadly sins: Sloth, Gluttony, 
Greed, Lust, Envy, Pride and Wrath. This already denotes that 
the killer wishes to send a message through these acts, they have 
a meaning and a purpose. Throughout the film, we observe how 
calculated and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">hauntingly intelligent the murderer truly is</span>, as his 
identity <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">remains anonymous to the other characters as well as 
the audience until the very end</span>.  
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The concept of the film is very interesting</span>, as it <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">has the audience wondering which sin the killer will pick next, 
and how he will represent it</span>. The movie also <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">has us questioning our own morals and principles</span>, which <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">makes the 
plot feel more real, as it raises real questions and feelings</span>. This is haunting because <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Se7en is an extremely dark 
cinematic piece</span>, which therefore means that on a certain level, this dark view matches our own reality. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The cast is 
extraordinary</span> as well, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">especially Kevin Spacey who plays the killer(whose name is purposely not included in the 
opening credits), despite his very short appearance, he still manages to make an impact</span>, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">he is perhaps the 
best choice I could think of for the role</span>. 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Cinematographically, Se7en is quite amazing</span>. Its aesthetic ties in with Fincher’s other films, as the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">gloomy and 
bleak atmosphere</span> usually conveys is definitely present here. The plot takes place in an unnamed city which <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I find 
quite interesting</span> because that means it could be anywhere. The <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">haunting darkness remains throughout the whole 
entire film</span> - except the ending, which is the only brightly lit scene in the whole movie. This <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">jarring choice</span> 
completely juxtaposes what actually happens in the ending. 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">There is no right way to describe the ending of this film in words, as one must see it themselves to truly 
understand</span>, but it revolves around the killer finding a way to strongly prove his <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">twisted point</span> and leave an <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="22" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">ever-
lasting mark</span>. The perception of the characters and the ideas of the film that the audience forms while watching is 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="23" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">completely turned upside down</span>. It is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="24" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">very poignant</span>, while being <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="25" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">extremely clever</span> at the same time. It does not 
even feel like an ending, because the idea of it remains alive long after watching it. 
To conclude, Se7en is an <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="26" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">outstanding film</span> from many points of view, including <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="27" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">plot, cast and cinematography</span>. It 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="28" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">has the audience completely captivated</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="29" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">questioning their own morals and thoughts</span>, which is what I believe a 
good and memorable movie should do - <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="30" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">get inside the mind of the audience</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="31" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">captivate them throughout the 
movie</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="32" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">keep them on the edge of their seat</span>, but also <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="33" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">leave them with something to think about after 
watching it</span>.

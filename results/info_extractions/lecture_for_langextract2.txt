every year I was talking about the same story. So then like Netflix and Blockbuster. Every year I would talking about the same story. So then if you already heard about that story, sorry. But because it's so important, so I want to talking about that. Anyone know Blockbuster raise your hand right now? Good, you're old enough. Okay. So because if you do not know that, which means you are young. Okay. And Blockbuster actually was the very successful was a successful company. You know what the past tense I have. Because you can see my record right here. They they function at November 6, 2013. Netflix is founded around 1997. And Blockbuster is founded around 1985.

And then, uh, your customer that, okay, so then if you charge for like $10, you can have two cassette in your hand. Something just like that. Originally, Netflix just want to, um, collaborate with Blockbuster because Blockbuster start earlier. They have store everywhere. And then they go to Netflix say, Oh, how can we collaborate? Then we have this pricing policy and something like that. So our customer can do one thing is actually pick up the cassette from your store and then return the cassette to your store. How do you think about that? Blockbuster consider that is enemy because they are in the same business even though it's different pricing policy.

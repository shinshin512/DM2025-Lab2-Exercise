[TRANSCRIPT - 00:00:00]
every year I was talking about the same story. So then like Netflix and Blockbuster. Every year I would talking about the same story. So then if you already heard about that story, sorry. But because it&#x27;s so important, so I want to talking about that. Anyone know Blockbuster raise your hand right now? Good, you&#x27;re old enough. Okay. So because if you do not know that, which means you are young. Okay. And Blockbuster actually was the very successful was a successful company. You know what the past tense I have. Because you can see my record right here. They they function at November 6, 2013. <span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Netflix is founded around 1997. And Blockbuster is founded around 1985. These two company actually want to provide almost the same core of philosophy to their customer. Video or whatever for the customer to know.</span> You know, when I actually went to the United States to study around that time, we don&#x27;t have Netflix around that time. Maybe we do, but it&#x27;s not that famous. I go to United States after 1997. Every international student, I want to say that because I want to make sure you understand. I go to United States after 1997. Okay, so not that old. But, um, Blockbuster around that time because not many people know about it. So every city, we actually can find a Blockbuster store. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">If you want to have a Friday movie night, you want to Blockbuster and to rent a movie and watching the movie with your friend. That is how our entertainment looks like over these student.</span> But then around that time we find out there something not good. What is not good? If you forget to return the cassette, return the tape to the store, you will have some fine, you&#x27;ll be charged a lot of money, like two times or three times more than that. Okay, not good. So then Netflix actually have totally different pricing policy. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Netflix policy is like you can actually charge thing monthly. Every month, you charge for some fee. And then, uh, your customer that, okay, so then if you charge for like $10, you can have two cassette in your hand. Something just like that.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Originally, Netflix just want to, um, collaborate with Blockbuster because Blockbuster start earlier. They have store everywhere. And then they go to Netflix say, Oh, how can we collaborate? Then we have this pricing policy and something like that. So our customer can do one thing is actually pick up the cassette from your store and then return the cassette to your store. How do you think about that? Blockbuster consider that is enemy because they are in the same business even though it&#x27;s different pricing policy.</span> So Blockbuster said, No. They probably thinking about if I say
